## Abstract

We will work through setting up and using a number of static analysis tools with grails such as Codenarc, Cobertura, JSLint, and others. I will go over what these tools help find and what items they can miss. Also I will show these tools paired with Jenkins in order to help trend the data and start enforcing new stricter standards on an existing codebase.
